💡 Use Cases
This extension is versatile and can be invaluable for:

📩 HR Professionals: Quickly replying to job applications, interview requests, or candidate follow-ups.

📧 Students: Crafting professional emails for internships, academic inquiries, or networking.

💼 Business Professionals: Streamlining project communications, client follow-ups, and internal team coordination.

🧑‍💻 Developers: Responding to technical discussions, bug reports, or open-source contributions.

🎓 Educators: Managing student queries, feedback, or administrative communications efficiently.

🛠️ Customer Support Teams: Sending rapid, consistent, and helpful responses to customer inquiries.

🤔 Why I Built This
Manually replying to every email is a significant time-sink in our daily lives. While large language models like Gemini are powerful, the constant need to copy-paste email content into a separate chat interface is inefficient and disruptive to the workflow.

I envisioned a tool that could:
"What if I could just ask the AI to write a reply instantly — without leaving my inbox?"

Thus, QuickReply - Email Assistant was born. It's a practical tool designed to reduce cognitive load, improve email productivity, and save valuable time, allowing users to focus on more critical tasks.

🧪 Sample Email to Try
To see QuickReply in action, paste the following into the body of an email (e.g., a new draft) in Gmail:

Subject: Interview Confirmation – Data Analyst Internship

Body:
Dear Neha,

We received your resume for the Data Analyst Internship. Please confirm your interest in proceeding and share your availability for a short virtual interview this week.

This tool will generate a polite, professional reply with a suitable tone and formatting.
